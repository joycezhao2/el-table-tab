El Table is a student-run cooperative cafe located in a cozy basement at Wellesley College. Our core values are inclusivity and sustainability, which we serve along side freshly brewed coffee, yummy pastries, and the best sandwiches on campus!

## What is this?
I'm building this little side project to make our ordering and tab system a little bit more automated and reliable. Using Google Apps Script allows our coop members to operate on a familiar UI to our old tab sheet system, while simply filling out forms removes direct interaction with our raw tab data. 

My goal is to help alleviate any discrepancies and increase the reliability of our tab system. By placing orders through a form rather than manually entering prices into a spread sheet, our co-op members won't have to worry about errors during those hectic lunch rush hours. This way, we can focus even more on serving the needs of our sweet Wellesley community!

This is a work in progress, so stay tuned for more updates throughout the semester!
